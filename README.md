Resume
======

An online resume for work.

I wanted a simple resume that is similar to a single-page design, but wanted to give it a bit of interactivity.  
I focused on a nicer smoothy transitioning backdrop.
One other idea I had in mind was to incorporate switching of different resumes but keep the same page ([/resume](http://nanosmasher.github.io/resume)).
 - As Github limited the use of php and other server request handlers I used JS to hide/show pages.
 - It's not a fullproof solution but the simplistic model is loaded quickly enough
